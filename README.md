The program is licensed under the "MIT License" which gives you the freedom to do almost anything with it.
I wrote not the whole application by myself. A small amount of code was written by other people. These people were so kind to distribute it under loose conditions. Due to that fact that I was able to use their
Intellectual Property, I want to speak my best wishes to: Philippe "Philo" Hurbain, Michael Hoffer, L. Paul Chew and Matthias Mann.
