COLOUR_MODS     = Inside faces & lines (colour 11 & 1), outside faces & lines (14 & 28), unknown (7 & 0)
DESCRIPTION     = The Intersector tool allows to cut surfaces along the intersection with another.\nAll triangles, quads, lines and conditional lines in cut file are split where they meet triangles or quads.\nThe intersection line is not calculated, you'll have to use Isecalc on the same input files to create it.\n\nNote: Intersector will hide everything what is not part of the result.\nClick on "Show All" in the 3D editor to restore the current view.
HIDE_OTHER      = Hide objects which are not the intersection result.
NO_MODS         = No colour modifications.
SCOPE_FILE      = Scope: File
SCOPE_SELECTION = Scope: Selection
TITLE           = Intersector [Arbitrary Precision]\nResults are rounded to 6 decimal places.\nThe scope is fixed to the selection and the minimum line segment length is 0.0001 LDU.
VERBOSE         = Verbose
VERBOSE_MSG     = {0} Lines(s) created\n{1} Triangle(s) created\n{2} Condline(s) created\n{3} Old line(s) deleted\n{4} Old triangle(s) deleted\n{5} Old quads(s) deleted\n{6} Old condlines(s) deleted
