ColourCodes        = Colour codes:\n\n1\u0009= Path 1\n2\u0009= Path 2\n4\u0009= Shape 1 Direction Vector\n5\u0009= Shape 1\n12\u0009= Shape 2 Direction Vector [optional]\n13\u0009= Shape 2 [optional]\n7\u0009= Line Indicators [optional]\n0\u0009= Line Ending Normal Indicators [optional]\n
ControlCurve       = Control transition curve, from 1 (linear) to 10 (s-shape, default) to 100 (step):
ControlCurveCenter = Control transition curve centering. 0 <= position <= 1. Default is 0.5, centered:
InvertShape        = Invert shape winding:
InvertShape1       = Use original winding (default).
InvertShape2       = Invert winding.
LineThresh         = If path has a sharper angle, a line is created at the junction. Default is 180\u00B0 (no line).\\nUse a negative value to force line creation:
MaxPathLength      = Define maximum path segment length. Longer segments are split (100000, default):
NumTransitions     = Sets the number of transitions from shape1 to shape2 and vice versa (1, default):
RotAngle           = Specify rotation of shape direction vector around path1 as it sweeps along the path. Default is 0\u00B0:
ShapeComp          = Compensation at sharp path angles:
ShapeComp1         = No compensation (default).
ShapeComp2         = The shape is elongated to compensate for flattening at sharp path angles.
Title              = PathTruder [Double Precision, IEEE-754]\nResults are rounded to 6 decimal places.
