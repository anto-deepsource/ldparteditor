COLOUR_CODES         = This utility allows to create a surface by extrusion of a shape along a path.\nThe path is defined as two sets of lines (colour 1 and colour 2).\nThe shape is also a set of lines (colour 5).\n\n Colour codes:\n\n1\u0009= Path 1\n2\u0009= Path 2\n4\u0009= Shape 1 Direction Vector\n5\u0009= Shape 1\n12\u0009= Shape 2 Direction Vector [optional]\n13\u0009= Shape 2 [optional]\n7\u0009= Line Indicators [optional]\n0\u0009= Line Ending Normal Indicators [optional]\n
CONTROL_CURVE        = Control transition curve, from 1 (linear) to 10 (s-shape, default) to 100 (step):
CONTROL_CURVE_CENTER = Control transition curve centering. 0 <= position <= 1. Default is 0.5, centered:
INVERT_SHAPE         = Invert shape winding:
INVERT_SHAPE_1       = Use original winding (default).
INVERT_SHAPE_2       = Invert winding.
LINE_THRESH          = If path has a sharper angle, a line is created at the junction. Default is 180\u00B0 (no line).\r\nUse a negative value to force line creation:
MAX_PATH_LENGTH      = Define maximum path segment length. Longer segments are split (100000, default):
NUM_TRANSITIONS      = Sets the number of transitions from shape1 to shape2 and vice versa (1, default):
ROT_ANGLE            = Specify rotation of the shape direction vector around path1 as it sweeps along the path. Default is 0\u00B0:
SHAPE_COMP           = Compensation at sharp path angles:
SHAPE_COMP_1         = No compensation (default).
SHAPE_COMP_2         = The shape is elongated to compensate for flattening at sharp path angles.
TITLE                = PathTruder [Double Precision, IEEE-754]\nResults are rounded to 6 decimal places.
VERBOSE              = Verbose
VERBOSE_MSG          = {0} Line(s) created\n{1} Triangle(s) created\n{2} Quad(s) created
