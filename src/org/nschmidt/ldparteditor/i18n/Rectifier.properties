Colour1        = No colour modifications.
Colour2        = Converted triangles are colored in yellow, newly formed rect primitives are colored blue.
MaxAngle       = Maximum angle formed by two triangles (default: 0.95\u00B0)
Rect1          = Convert bordered rhombuses into rect primitives.
Rect2          = Do not convert bordered rhombuses into rect primitives.
Rect3          = Convert to rect primitives, if possible.
Rect4          = Rectifier does not convert quad to rect when the quad has adjacent condline(s).\nThis may improve smooth shading of the part.
ScopeFile      = Scope: File
ScopeSelection = Scope: Selection
Title          = Rectifier [Arbitrary Precision]
TriQuads1      = Transform triangles into quads.
TriQuads2      = Rectifier does not attempt to transform triangles into quads.
