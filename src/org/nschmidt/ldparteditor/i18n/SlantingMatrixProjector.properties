COPY_TO_CLIPBOARD         = Copy matrix to clipboard
HOW_TO                    = There are two possibilies to use this tool:\n\na) Two-line variant\n\n\t1. Create two lines with one common vertex.\n\t\tExample A: (red line = X axis, blue line = Z axis)\n\t\t\t2 4 0 0 0 1 0 0\n\t\t\t2 1 0 0 0 0 0 1\n\t\tExample B: (red line = X axis, green line = Y axis)\n\t\t\t2 4 0 0 0 1 0 0\n\t\t\t2 2 0 0 0 0 1 0\n\n\t2. Select only these two lines in the 3D editor (LDPE will automatically calculate the matrix)\n\n\t3. Select the element(s) which should be changed and open this tool again.\n\na) Three-line variant\n\n\t1. Create three lines with one common vertex. One red line for the X axis, one green line for the Y axis, and one blue line for the Z axis.\n\t\tExample:\n\t\t\t2 4 0 0 0 1 0 0\n\t\t\t2 2 0 0 0 0 1 0\n\t\t\t2 1 0 0 0 0 0 1\n\n\t2. Select only these three lines in the 3D editor (LDPE will automatically calculate the matrix)\n\n\t3. Select the element(s) which should be changed and open this tool again.
MATRIX_FOR_XY             = Calculated slant matrix for X and Y (press ESC to cancel). 
MATRIX_FOR_XYZ            = Calculated slant matrix for X, Y and Z (press ESC to cancel). 
MATRIX_FOR_XZ             = Calculated slant matrix for X and Z (press ESC to cancel). 
MATRIX_FOR_YZ             = Calculated slant matrix for Y and Z (press ESC to cancel).
MATRIX_READY              = The following matrix will be applied to your selection:
NO_SELECTION_THREE_AXES   = You haven't selected anything, but the following matrix is calculated based on three axes:
NO_SELECTION_TWO_AXES     = You haven't selected anything, but the following matrix is calculated based on two axes:
RESET_SUBFILE_ORIENTATION = Reset subfile orientation
SET_ORIGIN                = Set origin to center of the first axis pair (useful for rect-primitives)
TITLE                     = SlantingMatrixCalculator [Arbitrary Precision]\nGenerates and applies a projection matrix from 2 or 3 lines to any selection.
