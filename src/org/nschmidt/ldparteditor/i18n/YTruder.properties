DESCRIPTION             = YTruder works on a set of selected lines (TYPE 2).\nIt creates a sheet of triangles and quads from a set of lines.\nThis is done by extrusion in the specified LDraw direction.
EXTRUDE_RADIALLY        = Extrude radially
PROJECTION_ON_PLANE     = Projection on plane
SYMMETRY_ACROSS_PLANE   = Symmetry across plane
TITLE                   = YTruder [Double Precision, IEEE-754]\nResults are rounded to 6 decimal places.
TRANSLATION_BY_DISTANCE = Translation by distance
